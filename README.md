# Portfolio

This is the code repository for my [personal portfolio website](https://nathan68560.github.io/Portfolio/) that is heberged and automatically rebuild on GitHub Pages after every push on the main branche.

The portfolio is made with Angular and consist of a single page with a presentation of me and my past work experiences, as well as a showcase of my different personal projects with, for some of them, a link to an online build to try them out.
